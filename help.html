<h2>Velocity Time graph with constant acceleration Experiment</h2>
<h3>About the experiment</h3>
<p>The experiment shows the velocity time graph for a given initial velocity and acceleration</p>
<h3>Animation control</h3>
<p>The top line has animation controls. There are two states of the experiment.</p>
<h3>The setup stage</h3>
<p>The initial state is setup stage. In this stage, you can see a control window at the right. You have access to four sliders.</p>
<p>You can control the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial Velocity&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;Provides the initial velocity for the graph</li>
<li>Acceleration&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;Provides the acceleration for the graph</li>
<li>Acceleration&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;Provides the acceleration for the graph</li>
<li>Distance&nbsp;:&nbsp;Displays the distance covered between time interval t1 and t2</li>
<li>Time1&nbsp;:&nbsp;Provides the time t1 from where distance is to be calculated</li>
<li>Time2&nbsp;:&nbsp;Provides the time t2 till where distance is to be calculated.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a car which travels along a straight line as per the distance in the time interval t1 to t2</p>
    <p>The graph canvas in the center is the velocity time graph for the given velocity and acceleration</p>
<p>Once you setup the experiment, you can enter the animation stage by clicking the start button</p>
<h3>The animation stage</h3>
<p>In the animation stage, the distance is computed and the car moves slowly from its initial position to its final position at time t2</p>
<p>The distance travelled between t1 and t2 is displayed on the slider Text labelled Distance</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial Velocity&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;</li>
<li>Acceleration&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;</li>
<li>Time1&nbsp;:&nbsp;</li>
<li>Time2&nbsp;:&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>You have to refresh the page to reset the experiment.</p>
<p>The controls can be hidden by clicking on close controls for unhindered view.</p>
<h2>Happy Experimenting</h2>
