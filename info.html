<h2>Velocity Time graph with constant acceleration Experiment</h2>
<h3>About the experiment</h3>
<p>The experiment shows a velocity time graph and a car. The graph is drawn as per the given initial velocity and uniform acceleration.</p>
<h3>Distance Calculation</h3>
<p>An object in uniform accelerated motion follows three equations of motion. Using the second equation of motion its displacement can be calculated at any given time.</p>
<p>First the displacement till t1 is calculated using the equation.</p>
<p>Then from the displacement till time t2 is found out using the same equation. The difference between the two displacements is the net displacement for the given motion.</p>
<p>The particle has been assumed to be moving in one dimensional on.</p>
<h3>The Second Equation of Motion</h3>
<p>A particle starting its motion with an initial velocity U and acceleration A will cover a distance which can be found by the area under the velocity time curve.</p>
<p>The displacement upto time t from the graph can be expressed as a sum of a rectangle's area and a triangle's area.</p>
<h3>S=u*t+0.5*a*t*t</h3>
